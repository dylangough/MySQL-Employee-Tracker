<h2>What is this?</h2>

The Employee Tracker application displays a list of employees within the work group. It allows the user to input new Employees, their role and salaries along with what department they are apart of. While looking through the employee bank you can also pick and choose employees from specific departments and either change or remove them from the bank.
